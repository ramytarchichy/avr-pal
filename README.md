## WARNING: I was an idiot.

I didn't know what the fuck I was doing back then. I didn't even understand how
interrupts work. This code *works*, barely, but I wrote this WAYYY back and the
code is a steaming pile of shit. Avoid at all costs.

It was just me dicking around with microcontrollers, without access
to even basic tools like an oscilloscope. I'm amazed that it works at all if I'm
honest.

It does however generate a fairly high-resolution video signal, and even has a
character framebuffer. I'll keep it up here just in case I wanna revisit it in
the future, but chances are if I need video these days, I'll probably go for an
FPGA.
